# discord.js_cleverbot
A basic bot that responds when mentioned on Discord
If you know JavaScript and discord.js, you could skip this, but read everything to be sure that it's correctly done.

## How to set-up
1. Download node.js from http://nodejs.org
2. Make a bot here https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me after this, you should have a token here http://i.imgur.com/Td9M6F7.png
3. Make the bot join your place with this URL: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=bot (Please repalce the CLIENT_ID with your bot client id, shown here: http://i.imgur.com/MTnVgmk.png )
4. Now you have your bot inside, have fun

## Installing
When you have downloaded nodejs, do the following in a CMD/Terminal:
- npm install discord.js --save
- npm install cleverbot-node --save
- npm install entities --save

Now edit the file called **config.json** and place in your token (Yes, that easy)


## How to use
Open a CMD/Terminal and type the following:
- node your/script/folder/index.js

If we would have done this on my computer, it would be:
- (Windows) -> node C:\users\alexflipnote\cleverbot\index.js
- (Linux) -> node /home/alexflipnote/Desktop/cleverbot/index.js

(You need to find your directory, don't copy the examples.)
